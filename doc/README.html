<div align="center"><h1>CRONOPETE 1.2.0</h1></div>

<p>The Apple's TimeMachine clone for Linux</p>

<p>Cronopete is a backup program, designed to mimic Apple's TimeMachine as close
as possible. Currently it only does backups, but lacks the restoring interface.
This is not a problem, because files are stored without compressing, so you can
just go to your backup hard disk and copy the desired file to your home folder.
In future versions, an interface for this will be added, using clutter.</p>

<p>The name comes from <i>anacronopete</i> (who flies through time), which is a time machine featured in the novel from Enrique Gaspar y Rimbaud, and
published in 1887 (eight years before than H.G. Wells'<i>Time Machine</i>.</p>

<p>Cronopete is distributed under <a href="gpl.html">GPL v3 license</a>.</p>

<h2>How does it work?</h2>

<p>Cronopete makes a full copy of the local hard disk each hour, storing it <i>as-is</i> in an external hard disk. To save space and speed up the copy
proccess, only modified files are copied, while non-modified files are linked to the previous backup. That way, if a file of 4GB is not modified, it won't
occupy 4GB in each backup, but only in the first one.</p>

<p>Cronopete uses only the date to decide if a file has been modified or not since last backup, so it's very fast and uses very little CPU and disk
resources. It also does as many operations as possible in the external hard disk, to reduce the traffic in the main hard disk.</p>

<p>Storing the files <i>as-is</i> allows to restore a file without needing specific tools, just using your usual file manager.</p>

<p>To save even more disk space, cronopete keeps only hourly copies for the last 24 hours. In the past month stores a daily copy. Finally, keeps a
weekly copy until the hard disk is full.</p>

<p>Finally, to ensure the integrity of the backups, cronopete follows these steps:</p>
<ul>
<li>Copy all the files to a temporary folder in the external hard disk. This temporary folder is clearly marked as it, so, in case that the backup fails,
it's easily deleted.</li>
<li>Syncs the hard disk to dump all the cache data, ensuring that all the files have been physically stored in the media.</li>
<li>Renames the temporary folder to its final name.</li>
<li>Syncs again the hard disk to ensure that the name change has been physically stored.</li>
</ul>

<p>This procedure ensures that a backup, when successful, will remain correct even in the case of power failure or other problems.</p>

<p>Currently, it only can do backups to local hard disks; in a near future I hope to add support for remote disks.</p>

<p>Version 1.2.0 still doesn't have an interface to restore files, so you have to do it manually using your favorite file manager. In a near future I
hope to build an interface, using clutter, which mimics the apple's one.</p>

<p>Cronopete creates in the external disk a folder, called <strong>cronopete</strong>, and inside it creates one folder for each user using it. The name of these
folders are the user login name.</p>
<p>Then, inside each user folder, cronopete creates one folder for each backup. The name of that folder follows the format:</p>
<div align="center"><p>YYYY_MM_DD_hh:mm:ss_unixtime</p></div>
<p>Being <em>YYYY</em> the year, <em>MM</em> the month, <em>DD</em> the day, <em>hh</em> the hour, <em>mm</em> the minutes, <em>ss</em> the seconds, all
of them in local time; and <em>unixtime</em> the UTC time in UNIX format (seconds since Jan, 1, 1970). If the folder begins with a <em>B</em> letter, is
a temporal backup (one that is still being made).</p>

<h2>Installing Cronopete</h2>

<p>Cronopete is written in Vala, so you need to install it:</p>
<p><ul>
<li>A recent version of Vala (0.12 or later)</li>
<li>GSL library</li>
<li>Gee library</li>
<li>GTK+ 2.20 or later</li>
<li>(Optional) ReiserFS tools (for Reiser 3.0)</li>
</ul></p>

<p>If your Vala version is too old (maybe because you are using Ubuntu 11.04 or older), you can add the Vala team PPA, just typing in a terminal:</p>
<pre>sudo apt-add-repository ppa:vala-team/ppa</pre>
<p>followed by:</p>
<pre>sudo apt-get update</pre>

<p>After installing all the dependencies, you can type this to install cronopete in your system and get it ready to be automatically launched each time
you log into your session:</p>
<pre>make && sudo make install</pre>
<p>You can define the <strong>PREFIX</strong> variable in Make to choose where to install it. This is, to
install it into <i>/usr</i> instead of <i>/usr/local</i>, just use:</p>
<pre>make install -D PREFIX=/</pre>
<p>And to install it in <i>/tmp/package</i>, just use:</p>
<pre>make install -D /tmp/package</pre>
<p>Now, in order yo run it, just type</p>
<pre>make launch</pre>
<h2>Using Cronopete</h2>
<p>After a delay of 2 seconds, you will see this orange icon in your system tray:</p>
<div align="center"><img src="cronopete1.png" /></div>
<p>This icon shows the current status of Cronopete. If it's red, then there's a critical problem that prevents backups to be done (like if there's no external
disk configured or connected, or the backups are disabled). If it's orange, then there was some problem during backup (like when one file wouldn't be backed
up, or can't access into a folder). If it's green or white, all is working fine.</p>
<p>When cronopete is doing a backup, the icon is animated, like a backward-moving clock. When it stops, the backup ended.</p>
<p>Now it's time to configure cronopete. If you click on the icon, you will see this menu:</p>
<div align="center"><img src="cronopete2.png" /></div>
<p>By clicking on <span class="menu">Open cronopete preferences...</span> you will see the main window:</p>
<div align="center"><img src="cronopete3.png" /></div>
<p>Here are two tabs: the main, with all the configuration options, and the <span class="menu">Log</span> tab, where you can check if a backup ended fine, or there were errors.</p>
<p>The first thing to do is to choose the external hard disk to use to do the backups. By clicking the <span class="menu">Change disk</span> button a windows with the currently
mounted USB hard disks will be shown:</p>
<div align="center"><img src="cronopete4.png" /></div>
<p>If we choose the MSDOS/FAT formatted disk, a new window will be shown:</p>
<div align="center"><img src="cronopete6.png" /></div>
<p>The best file system to use is ReiserFS because it supports <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tail_packing">tail packing</a>, which allows to optimize
the disk usage; but EXT3/EXT4 is also allowed. BTRFS is not allowed because it still has bugs which prevents it to be reliabely used with cronopete.</p>
<p>If you click the <span class="menu">Format disk</span> button, cronopete will try to format the disk in ReiserFS format; if it fails (let's say, because reiserfstools are not
installed in the system), then it will try to format it in EXT4 format. Of course, this operation will erase all the data in the external disk.</p>
<p>When the disk is ready, cronopete will show its main window like this:</p>
<div align="center"><img src="cronopete7.png" /></div>
<p>Now we can see the currently active disk, the available disk space, when the first and last backups were made and when will be done the next backup, the
current status, and, in the switch under the <strong>anaCRONOPETE</strong> name, the ON/OFF status of cronopete.</p>
<p>Now it's time to set up the folders to backup. By clicking the <span class="menu">Options</span> button, this window will be shown:</p>
<div align="center"><img src="cronopete5.png" /></div>
<p>The first list contains the folders to be backed up. By default it backs up the HOME folder only, but you can add other folders if you like.</p>
<p>The second list contains the folders to be skip. By default is empty (but, internally, cronopete automatically refuses to backup the <span class="filename">.gvfs</span> folder
in your HOME directory, for obvious reasons). You can add here folders like <span class="filename">aMule's Incoming</span> folder, or similar. The first list takes precedence over
this, so if a folder is in both lists, it will be backed up.</p>
<p>Then, the checkbutton at the bottom allows you to avoid to back up the hidden files and folders in your HOME directory. By unchecking it, cronopete
will not backup them (but hidden files/folders in other folders will be copied). Again, the first list takes precedence over this, so you can uncheck it
to save disk space, but add your <span class="filename">HOME/.mozilla-thunderbird</span> folder in the first list to backup all your local mail.</p>
<p>Finally, you can choose the time interval between backups. By default it is one hour, but you can set it to up 12 hours (but I strongly recommend to keep
it to one backup each hour).</p>
<p>Here is an example of this:</p>
<div align="center"><img src="cronopete8.png" /></div>
<h2>Restoring files</h2>
<p>Currently there is no specific interface for restoring files, so it has to be done manually. But since files are stored "as is", without compression,
is as easy as opening the external disk and copy the desired files back to the main disk.</p>
<h2>Uninstalling cronopete</h2>
<p>To uninstall cronopete, just use <i>make uninstall</i>.</p>
